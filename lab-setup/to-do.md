# To-Do

This page contains a small list of stuff I still want to do and note down to keep track off. Which I might forget. So this isn't a complete list of stuff!

* Research the account operator group privileges more. There should be something to become DA! Generic all on all these groups:

* Add a enumeration section to the attack path manual for enumerating the domain with PowerView and BloodHound. Either make one page on how to enumera a domain for example or add it inbetween the already existing sections.
* Add GPO's to disable/enable the firewall and defender on specific machines? Crackmapexec doesn't work nicely with the firewall enabled. Test if this is only with local admin account or all local admins? Also with DA? Also check [https://github.com/Mr-Un1k0d3r/SCShell](https://github.com/Mr-Un1k0d3r/SCShell)
