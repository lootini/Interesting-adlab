# Prerequisite

The lab exists of 8 machines. This requires a fair bit of resources to run. It is not required to run the whole lab at once, it is possible to run only a couple of machines and turn them on/off depending on your needs. More info on this will be provided later.

* 32GB of ram
* 4 cores with 8 threads
* 1TB of storage
* VmWare Workstation, ESXI or Virtual Box

We recommend following the lab-setup guide from start to finish, since some pages might require a configuration from the step before. If a misconfiguration has a prerequisite from another misconfiguration, we try to link to it in the page.
