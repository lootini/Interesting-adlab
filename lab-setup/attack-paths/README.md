# Attack Paths

The attack path section has two subsections:

{% content-ref url="configuring-attack-paths/" %}
[configuring-attack-paths](configuring-attack-paths/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The pages in configuring attack paths will link to the pages to build out the attack paths. To build the attack paths going to each misconfiguration page and following the chapter "Configuring" is required.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="tasks-and-guide/" %}
[tasks-and-guide](tasks-and-guide/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The pages in Task & Guide will link to tasks in each attack path to give some direction and a full manual on how to exploit the whole attack path and own the whole lab.
