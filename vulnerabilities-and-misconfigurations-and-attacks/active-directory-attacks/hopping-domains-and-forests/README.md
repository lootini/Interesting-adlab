# Hopping domains and forests

{% hint style="info" %}
The subpages will not be a complete list of all possible ways to attack trusts. This is a lab and it won't be possible to cover everything. But as we keep expanding the lab new attacks will be added.
{% endhint %}

It is also possible to hop domains and forests with SQL links, even if there are no trusts between the domains. This is because SQL server links can be setup using SQL server accounts. This isn't included in the lab but just remeber that its possible. Its just the same as abusing the links from the lab.
