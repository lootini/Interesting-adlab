# Password Spraying

## Configuring

To implement the attack we need to set a weak password for one of the users we enumerated. The easiest way is by using the `net user` command in cmd. To change the password for `john` to `Welcome01!` execute the following command:

```
net user john Welcome01! /domain
```
